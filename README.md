# React-MySQL-Node Application

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the integration of a simple React application with a MySQL database via a Node.js/Express.js server. It shows how to effectively implement and manage a server solution for applications using ReactJS and MySQL. This project is ideal for developers who want to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and develop their own applications.

## Technologies

- **React.js**: Frontend framework used for building user interfaces. Ensures efficient rendering of components.
- **Vite**: Next generation frontend tooling, used here for building and serving the React application with optimizations like fast hot module replacement.
- **Node.js/Express.js**: The backend is powered by Express running on Node.js, which simplifies the server creation and routing.
- **MySQL**: Used as the database to store application data, accessed from the Node.js application.
- **Nodemon**: Utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, used in development.
- **CORS**: Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
- **ESLint**: JavaScript linter used in the frontend for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, helping to make code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
